      <p>
        From my humble beginnings working on my fathers farm I learned the value
        of hard work. After spending time with our family DOS computer, I
        developed an interest in all things technology. This led to me attending
        the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee in pursuit of a bachelors degree
        in computer science. Once acquired I moved to Madison WI and began my
        professional career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I work as a staff software engineer at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.acquia.com/products/acquia-dam">Acquia</a>{' '}
        specializing in front end. I have a wonderful wife and 2 boys that I
        enjoy spending as much time with as possible. When I'm not working I
        enjoy biking, listening to podcasts and audio books, playing video
        games, reading books, fishing, and gardening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going forward I want to continue making a difference on teams. Improving
        aging codebases, building out new features, and making other developers'
        lives easier. Above all I want to raise good kids that go on to make a
        difference in this world.
